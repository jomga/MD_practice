    "# Ligand preperations using OpenMM, RDkit, OpenFF and GaFF\n",
    "\n",
    "The ligand preparation process is crucial when constructing protein-ligand complexes for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, issues can arise when non-standard residues or ligands are present due to the constraints of classical forcefields. Remember that classical MD essentially refers to a parameterized list of bonds, angles, torsion angles, and non-bonded interaction parameters, aiming to replicate chemically reasonable behavior. This process is relatively straightforward for standard biomolecular structures like proteins, RNA, or DNA, which are composed of repeating units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ligands, however, can present challenges. Their novel connectivity or unusual elements make the construction of a forcefield description more difficult. As it's not feasible to tabulate all possible combinations of ligand interactions with biomolecules, we must instead process the ligand using a more generalized forcefield. While this approach might not be as precise as a carefully tuned forcefield, it generally provides sufficient insight into the structure and dynamics for most cases."

    "# Creating OpenMM Compatible Files Using RDKit\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this segment, we aim to create a protein-ligand assembly that's ready for an OpenMM simulation. To do this, we'll take a ligand in the .sdf format, prepare it, and convert it into a format compatible with OpenMM. An important consideration is ensuring the ligand's optimal placement relative to the protein to avoid any unnecessary distance or overlap. This process can be expedited by using Nanome to design the ligand and establish a suitable starting position for molecular dynamics (MD). However we will be using the default palcement of the bound complex to begin with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the Ligand\n",
    "he first step is to load the ligand from the .sdf file. Subsequently, we'll use RDKit to attach hydrogen atoms to the ligand, as this improves the accuracy of our simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting to OpenMM-Compatible Format\n",
    "After attaching the hydrogen atoms, we'll use the OpenMM.Molecule function to transition the ligand into a format OpenMM can work with. This will enable us to use OpenMM to construct our protein-ligand complex in a standardized format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll visually inspect the prepared ligand with RDKit's 2D viewer and ngview to ensure accurate bond orders."

The function provided below accomplishes this task. Although a deep understanding of the underlying process isn't necessary for this example, here's a brief overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function identifies the elements in the SDF file and processes this information to construct a topology (or connectivity) for the molecule. Using this topology, we can then apply the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) to create all the necessary parameters for the bond, angle, and dihedrals of the ligand.\n"
