    "## Solvating protein systems\n",
    "Solvating a protein is not as simple as placing water molecules randomly around the protein. The water model used can significantly impact the accuracy and computational cost of the simulation. The TIP3P model is one of the most commonly used water models in molecular dynamics simulations. It's a simple and computationally efficient model, where each water molecule is represented as a rigid structure with three interaction sites: two positive hydrogen atoms and one negative oxygen atom. In OpenMM, you can solvate a protein with TIP3P water molecules using the Modeller.addSolvent() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the TIP3P model has its limitations. It is a rigid model, meaning that it does not account for the flexibility of the water molecules. This can lead to inaccuracies in the simulation, particularly when modeling specific types of interactions, such as hydrogen bonding. Moreover, TIP3P does not include polarization effects, which can be important in certain biological systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to explicit solvation (like with TIP3P) is implicit solvation, where the solvent is not represented by individual molecules, but rather by a continuous medium. This is implemented in OpenMM through Generalized Born (GB) models. Implicit solvation drastically reduces the number of particles in the system, leading to significantly faster simulations. It's particularly useful for simulations where solvent-solute interactions are important, but the fine details of the solvent structure are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, implicit solvation also has its drawbacks. It is less accurate than explicit solvation for modeling the structure and dynamics of the solvation shell around the protein. It also fails to capture certain phenomena, such as the formation of solvent voids or cavities, and it cannot be used to simulate processes that involve explicit water molecules, such as the diffusion of small molecules through water.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP3P is a computationally efficient model that can provide a good approximation of water for many systems, but it has its limitations. Implicit solvation can speed up your simulations and may be a good choice for certain types of systems, but it lacks the accuracy of explicit solvation for modeling detailed solvent structure and dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When explicit solvation is useful\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit solvent models are particularly important in a number of contexts where the specific arrangement or behavior of water molecules plays a critical role in the biological system being studied. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protein folding and stability:** Protein folding is driven by a delicate balance of various forces, including hydrophobic collapse, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions. Water plays a vital role in all of these, and its explicit representation allows for an accurate simulation of the folding process and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enzyme catalysis:** Water often plays a direct role in the mechanisms of enzymatic reactions, for example, as a reactant, a product, or through mediating proton transfers. In these cases, an explicit water model is necessary to accurately simulate the catalytic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protein-ligand interactions:** In drug design, the binding of a small molecule ligand to a protein can be significantly influenced by water. Water molecules can mediate protein-ligand interactions, and displacement of water from the binding site can contribute to the binding energy. Explicit water models can capture these effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protonation state effects:** The protonation state of a protein, which can be influenced by the surrounding water environment, can dramatically affect its structure and function. Explicit solvent simulations can help to capture these effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Membrane proteins:** The interaction of membrane proteins with the lipid bilayer and the surrounding aqueous environment is critical for their function. Explicit water is necessary to correctly model these interactions.eractions.ynamics."

    "This code block performs the conversion of ligand structures from PDB to SDF format, and subsequently processes these structures for chemical analysis. Initially, Open Babel (pybel) is utilized to accurately convert PDB files into SDF files, ensuring correct inference and retention of aromaticity, a crucial aspect often lost in straightforward conversions. Following this, RDKit is employed to read the generated SDF files. Within this RDKit processing step, specific attention is given to nitrogen atoms with four bonds, which are adjusted to reflect a quaternary ammonium ion's positive charge state. After this adjustment, RDKit's sanitization process is applied to each molecule to perceive aromaticity and establish other molecular properties accurately. Finally, the processed molecular structures are written back into SDF format, making them suitable for further computational chemistry analyses or molecular modeling tasks."

    "In this section, we will be building protein-ligand complexes by creating an OpenMM-compatible ligand file (sdf/mol2) from an RDKit molecule. The ligand we will be using is in .sdf file format that we will need to convert it and prepear it for simulation. To ensure smooth simulation need to ensure that its desired position is relative to the protein to avoid it being too far away or inside the protein. Nanome can be used to design the ligand and construct a good starting positions for dynamics, which can significantly accelerate MD.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the Ligand\n",
    "To begin, we will load the ligand from the .sdf file format. Once we have the ligand, we can add hydrogens to it using RDKit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting to OpenMM-Compatible Format\n",
    "After adding hydrogens to the ligand, we can convert it to an OpenMM-compatible format using the OpenMM.Molecule function. This will allow us to build the protein-ligand complex using OpenMM by getting them both in the same format.\n",

The below function will do the heavy lifting, for this example, we do not need to understand the deeper process, but effectively it works out the elements in the SDF file and processes it in order to construct a topology (connectivity)  for the molecule, this can then be used to used the general amber forcefield (GaFF) to create all the parameters for the bond, angle and dihedrals for the ligand."
